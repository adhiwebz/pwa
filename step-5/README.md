#Step-5: App Like
Web Manifest provides an extra control to the web application and gives app like experiences to the Progressive web application.

##Implementation
In *manifest.json* file, implement:
* Add to home screen
* Splash screen

##Running
You can see the option of *Add to home screen* on the 'More' options of the web page.

####Open [127.0.0.1:8888/step-5](http://127.0.0.1:8888/step-5) in your chrome browser.

Reload your page and then go to the *More tools* option in your chrome browser. Expand this section and you should see the option to 'Add to home screen' on the dialog box. When you click on it, you'll see an icon on the home screen of your device/chrome browser.

* Reload the page
* Clear the cache and reload the page again
